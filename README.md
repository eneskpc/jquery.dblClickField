# jQuery DoubleClickField
This project allows you to edit html element with double click.

## Why I prepared this jQuery Plugin
Because, I had to use this plugin for Private Project.
I created a reference for myself and I wanted to be a source for you.

## How to use this plugin?
This is very simple! First set id to your HTML tag (except input element) :
```
<h1 id="edit-element-1">jQuery DoubleClickField Test</h1>
```
```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
     $('#edit-element-1').dblClickField();
});
```
