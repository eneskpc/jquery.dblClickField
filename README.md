# jQuery DoubleClickField
This project allows you to edit html element with double click.

##Why I prepared this jQuery Plugin
Because, I had to use this plugin for Private Project.
I created a reference for myself and I wanted to be a source for you.

##How to use this plugin?
This is very simple!
```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
     $('#edit-element-1').dblClickField();
});
```
